[Schema](https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-schemas-and-types-part-1/) is the most important part of any [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) implementation. Schema is a centerpiece of any GraphQL service and defines the data-sets that can be queried by the client.

#### What's a schema stitching?
Imagine having a project where multiple teams are involved in each team:
- handles different aspects crucial to that service, 
- has to work on the schema to make sure that their part of the project would work as expected,
- must make sure that everything would work properly as a whole.

Cooperating on a huge project schema might be confusing...

Schema stitching is a process of merging multiple GraphQL schemas into one that can be queried. Itâ€™s an incredibly useful approach when it comes to building projects that require having both, unified & transparent access to a data split across multiple APIs (even without understanding where exactly itâ€™s located). It can be also used to customize an existing GraphQL API like adding custom resolvers or overriding existing ones of third-party [GraphQL service](https://graphqleditor.com/) or adding more fields to an existing type whose data comes from another data source.

#### Performing a schema stitching can cause troubles

Although putting two schemas into one in a way where there are no name collisions seems quite simple, but that's not a real schema stitching. What we want to achieve is one consistent schema, merged from multiple underlying GraphQL APIs. That's a way more difficult, but what if a told you that there is an app for that?


#### A better way

The latest release of [GraphQL Editor](https://graphqleditor.com/) introduced an easy way to collaborate on schemas. All we need to do is:

**1. Add two or more schemas to our account - you can load them from URL or .gql file**

**2. Initiate a new project**

**3. Pick schemas we want to have access to in our newly generated schema from the list & create a project**

... **and that's it!**

As long as we have managed to avoid conflicts between our underlying schemas, we should have access to all their elements in our newly generated project ðŸ‘Œ

I've decided to create a list of top resources to learn for two modern and trending technologies after checking results of [The stage of Javascript 2018 Survey](https://2018.stateofjs.com). The survey was completed by 20k users. React is, of course, the most popular among front end frameworks.

GraphQL is the top wanted to learn technology.

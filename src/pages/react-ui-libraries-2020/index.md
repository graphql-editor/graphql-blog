React is one of the most popular web frameworks. Well, not exactly a framework but rather a frontend library but itâ€™s often described this way and usually being mentioned or compared to other frameworks.

What's special about React is that it first introduced us the component-based architecture giving the direction for the web development industry. Seeing how well it was received, many other frameworks decided to adopt this approach as well.

React's modular nature created an ecosystem of UI libraries that is growing rapidly. You probably all know the most popular ones:

- [Material UI by Google](https://material-ui.com/),
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/),
- [Blueprint UI](https://blueprintjs.com/),
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/),

but there are plenty of smaller/less known libraries which are also awesome. Let's take a look at some of them! 

## Grommet

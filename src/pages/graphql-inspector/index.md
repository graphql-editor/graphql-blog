[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is really about collaboration, and the teams that get furthest are those who can work seamlessly together on their GraphQL API.

This idea is well-known for the members of [The Guild](https://github.com/the-guild-org) know from open-sourcing amazing graphql tools. Its members work constantly on new solutions aiming to automate & increase the type-safety of our GraphQL projects. After open-sourcing such tools as [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) or [GraphQL Modules](https://graphql-modules.com/), their next work seen daylight - the [GraphQL inspector](https://graphql-inspector.com/)


[GraphQL Inspector](https://graphql-inspector.com/) is a tool published by [Kamil Kisiela](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/), that detects changes, similar or duplicated types, validates documents against a schema and looks for deprecated usage.

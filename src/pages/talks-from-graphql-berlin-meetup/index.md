Since open-sourcing [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) specification in 2015, it gained a lot of popularity and is now used by many development teams, including giants like GitHub, Twitter or Airbnb. Why? Because GraphQL lets you describe the complex data dependencies with ease, another great thing about it is that you can use it with any language or platform.  

The rising popularity of GraphQL led to the formation of local meetups of GraphQL users. One of the most active European communities is a group of GraphQL fans from Berlin. If you are not from Berlin or subscribing [GraphQL Weekly](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/) (if so it's a good moment to do it), you might have missed the recordings of their recent meetup that took place at Berlin [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) office.

## The talks from GraphQL Berlin Meetup #15


#### "System Design and Architecture @ GraphQL" by Bogdan Nedelcu 


Designing GraphQL API's for scale is quite a challenge as GraphQL is relatively a new technology. Bogdan Nedelcu talked about system architecture patterns that have been around for a long time that GraphQL bases on.

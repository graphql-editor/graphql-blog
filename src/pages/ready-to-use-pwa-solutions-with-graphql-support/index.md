**Progressive Web Apps are the ultimate way to create ultra-fast webpages and apps with a mobile-first approach. Engaging for mobile users, PWAs are also an attractive technology for developers as they leverage modern JS frameworks and tech stack, including GraphQL.**

The story of progressive web apps starts with the PWA manifest announced by Google. In a single document, Google listed all the technical requirements and other things that make Progressive Web Apps reliable, fast and engaging. 

Following this list helps developers to build high-quality PWAs step by step, which might be time-consuming and require some knowledge on the edge of web and app development that is not always available in teams.

## Ready-to-use solutions for Progressive Web Apps

The other way is to leverage ready-to-use PWA solutions, which are popping out on the market at breakneck speed. Doing so guarantees a faster time-to-market, a bunch of additional modules and support of development.

There at least several solutions that ensure high-quality progressive web apps, such as Deity Falcon, Scandiweb or Vue Storefront, just to name a few. Apart from these independent solutions, leading CMS and eCommerce platform providers are also working on their own integrated PWA solutions (Magento, SAP Hybris).

Which of them supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)? Here’s the list!

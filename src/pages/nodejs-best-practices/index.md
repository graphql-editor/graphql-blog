Node.js is the most popular choice when building the backend for your app, no matter if you prefer a traditional REST API or using it to build something modern like the GraphQL server.


## Node.js

It's cross-platform, so whether you are building a mobile app, web app or IoT, Node will do the job. It's light, it's scalable & it delivers! Whether you are building a side project or working on an enterprise app Node.js will fit your needs.
